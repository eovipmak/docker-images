**Learning:** Users on mobile devices often struggle to clear long search queries. Adding a visible "Clear" button within the input field (revealed when text is present) significantly improves usability.
**Action:** Implement the "Search with Clear" pattern for all text filters: use `pr-10` on the input and position an absolute clear button on the right.
